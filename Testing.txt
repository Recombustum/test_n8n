Early season activity

The season began on May 23, when a tropical storm named Ewiniar formed southeast of Palau, marking it as the fifth-latest start of a Pacific typhoon season since reliable records began. It also made Ewiniar the fourth-latest time and ended a 157-day period (December 18, 2023 – May 24, 2024) during which no named storm was active in the basin.[8] Ewiniar tracked toward the Philippines, where it was named Aghon by PAGASA, the replacement name for Ambo. Ewiniar made nine landfalls in Homonhon Island; Giporlos, Eastern Samar; Basiao Island; Cagduyong Island; Batuan, Masbate; Masbate City; Torrijos, Marinduque; Lucena, Quezon and Patnanungan. It began to move over the warm tropical waters of Lamon Bay, where both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Ewiniar into a minimal typhoon. Ewiniar began its extratropical transition while it was 719 km (447 mi) east-northeast of Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan. On June 6, another extratropical cyclone[which?] would absorb the remnants of Ewiniar, just off the coast of Alaska. On May 30, another tropical depression formed southeast of Haikou, China. The next day, at 03:00 UTC, JTWC designated the disturbance as Tropical Depression 02W. A few hours later, JMA assigned the name Maliksi to 02W as they upgraded it into a tropical storm. Shortly after that, on May 31, Maliksi made landfall in Yangjiang, Guangdong. The JMA and JTWC discontinued warnings as Maliksi moved inland and dissipated on June 2. No storms formed in June for the first time since 2010.

After many weeks of inactivity, on July 13, a tropical depression formed east of Vietnam, designated as 03W. Shortly after, it tracked into Vietnam, dissipating soon after. On July 19, two tropical disturbances were recognized by the JTWC: one southeast of Manila and another east of Palau. Soon after, both disturbances developed into a depression, being named by PAGASA. The first one, west of Batangas, was named Butchoy while the second, east of Virac, was named Carina. Later that day, the JTWC followed suit, designating both as tropical depressions, with Butchoy being 04W and Carina as 05W. The next day, the more eastern disturbance, Carina, was named Gaemi by the JMA. On July 21, Butchoy also intensified into a tropical storm, receiving the name Prapiroon from the JMA. Prapiroon moved through the South China Sea as a mild tropical storm before making landfall over Wanning, Hainan. Prapiroon moved through Gulf of Tonkin, where it further intensified into a severe tropical storm. Early on July 23, Prapiroon made its second and final landfall in Quảng Ninh, Vietnam.

Situated in a favorable environment in the Philippine Sea, Gaemi continued to strengthen and became the second typhoon of this season. Gaemi rapidly intensified into a very strong typhoon, with 10-minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). Gaemi stalled and executed a counterclockwise loop near the coast, slightly weakening before making landfall over the northeastern coast of Taiwan. Weakened by the landfalls, the storm accelerated across the island and emerged into the Taiwan Strait, six hours after landfall. The next day, Gaemi made its final landfall at Xiuyu, Putian in Fujian Province as a weakening tropical storm. Moving inland, the storm rapidly weakened until it dissipated on July 27.

Even though Gaemi never made landfall in the Philippines, the storm's moisture would enhance the southwest monsoon. Heavy rainfalls were felt over Luzon and some parts of the Visayas, leaving the regions flooded. Overall, Gaemi caused 152 fatalities and US$4.57 billion worth of damages throughout its track.
Peak season activity
Four systems active on August 13: Tropical Depression Maria (top left); Tropical Storm Ampil (bottom left); Tropical Depression Son-Tinh (center right); and Tropical Depression 09W (bottom right; precursor to Wukong).

On August 3, a low-pressure area developed east of Kadena Air Base. At 00:00 UTC, JMA recognize the disturbance as a depression. However, it was downgraded to a remnant low on August 7. The convection later meandered south of Ryukyu Islands for a few days before JMA reclassified it again as a depression on August 11. JMA issued a gale warning the next day, citing that it would intensify in the following days. JTWC later followed suit and upgraded it into Tropical Depression 08W. On August 13, the depression became a tropical storm, receiving the name Ampil from the JMA. Ampil gradually intensified in the Pacific Ocean, becoming a severe tropical storm. JMA upgraded Ampil into a typhoon two days later, and the JTWC classified it as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon. The next day, it strengthened into a Category 4-equivalent typhoon. The typhoon passed just south of Greater Tokyo Area before weakening and transitioning to an extratropical cyclone.

On August 5, a low-pressure area formed in Bonin Islands. The disturbance was in an environment with low to moderate wind shear and warm SSTs. The JTWC later classified the disturbance as a depression the next day, giving it the designation 06W. Early on August 8, JMA upgraded the depression into a storm, naming it Maria. The storm further strengthened into a severe tropical storm on the same day. At the same time, JTWC reported that Maria had rapidly intensified into a typhoon due to strong equatorward and poleward outflow. However, on August 9, Maria weakened into a tropical storm as it moved northeastward. On August 10, another low-pressure area formed just southeast of Maria. The JTWC would classify the disturbance as a subtropical depression in their next bulletin. Despite being in a marginal environment and high wind shear, JMA upgraded into a tropical storm, giving it the name Son-Tinh. The next day, JTWC reported that Son-Tinh became tropical, designating it as 07W. Son-Tinh weakened back into a tropical depression before dissipating on August 14.

On the morning of August 12, Maria made landfall in Iwate Prefecture as a tropical storm, bringing strong winds and heavy rains in northern Japan. After moving inland, Maria weakened into a tropical depression. The storm entered the Sea of Japan, further weakening on the next day. The JTWC issued its final warning after Maria was last noted west-northwest of Misawa. JMA continued to track the depression before they issued their final warning at 04:15 UTC.

Activity increased when an area of convection was formed on August 12 near the southwest of Son-Tinh. JMA would immediately recognize the disturbance as a tropical depression. The next day, JTWC went on classifying it as a tropical depression, designating it 09W. Similar to Ampil, on August 13, 09W intensified into a tropical storm, receiving the name Wukong from the JMA. Wukong was short-lived due to its poorly organized cloud tops. JTWC made its final warning for Wukong as it moved through cooler waters and dissipated on August 15.

On August 17, JMA recognized a tropical depression that formed east of Taiwan. The next day, PAGASA declared the system a tropical depression, naming it Dindo. The depression was named Jongdari by the JMA three hours later upon intensification to a tropical storm. JTWC later followed suit and upgraded Jongdari into a tropical storm, with the designation of 10W. However, it did not last long and weakened into a tropical depression while nearing the Korean Peninsula. On August 21, JMA and JTWC reported that Jongdari had dissipated as its low-level circulation center faded when it moved over land. After Jongdari, a low-pressure area formed in the Northern Mariana Islands on the same day. The system intensified into a tropical storm the next day, with the JMA naming it Shanshan. JTWC then gave Shanshan the designation 11W.

Shanshan later strengthened into a Category 1-equivalent typhoon. It remained at that intensity as it battled through wind shear. As it went near the Amami Islands, it strengthened into a Category 4-equivalent typhoon. The approach of the typhoon caused the issuance of a special warning system in Kagoshima Prefecture, the first time in the area since Typhoon Nanmadol in 2022. Around 08:00 JST on August 29, Shanshan made landfall near Satsumasendai, making it the third tropical cyclone impacting mainland Japan this season. Rapid erosion later ensued as it moved eastward while inland. Shanshan heads over Seto Inland Sea before it makes another landfall in Shikoku on the next day. Shanshan's convection began to be disorganized, causing it to weaken into a remnant low. However, it strengthened back into a tropical depression as it moved east-southeastward through open waters. JMA continued to track Shanshan until it dissipated on September 1.
Typhoon Yagi making landfall over Wenchang City in Hainan on September 6

On August 30, a tropical disturbance formed near Palau. On the same day, JMA started to issue advisories for the system as a depression. As it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), the PAGASA named it Enteng on September 1. JTWC followed suit, and Enteng was classified as a tropical depression, with the designation 12W. At 21:00 JST (13:00 UTC), JMA classified Enteng as a tropical storm, naming the system Yagi. The storm made its first landfall in Casiguran in Aurora Province at 14:00 PHT on September 2. The mountainous terrain of the Cordillera Central made Yagi weaken as it moved inland. It exited the PAR early on September 4 as it continues to intensify in the South China Sea.

Entering the South China Sea, Yagi later strengthened into a typhoon due to its highly favorable environmental conditions. The following day, it rapidly intensified, developing a distinct eye and briefly reaching Category 5-equivalent super typhoon status at 00:00 UTC on September 5 as it approached Hainan. The whole cloud system of Yagi covered the entire South China Sea. Yagi slightly weakened before it made its second landfall over Wenchang City in Hainan. The storm then moved over Haikou, and continued to make another landfall in Xuwen County, Guangdong. Afterward, Yagi entered the open waters of the Gulf of Tonkin.

Yagi became one of only the four Category 5 typhoons recorded in the South China Sea, alongside Pamela in 1954, Rammasun in 2014, and Rai in 2021. It also marked the most powerful typhoon to strike Hainan in autumn since Typhoon Rammasun. On September 7, Yagi underwent a period of reorganization and regained Category 4 status before making a historic landfall between Haiphong and Quảng Ninh in Vietnam. Upon landfall, Yagi became the strongest storm in history to impact Northern Vietnam. The typhoon then rapidly weakened as it moved inland, becoming a tropical depression on September 8. The JMA continued monitoring the system before reporting that Yagi dissipated at 18:00 UTC on the next day. Even after dissipation, it still wreaked havoc, bringing heavy floods to Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand.

While Yagi was still on its way to making landfall in the Philippines, JTWC announced another formation of a tropical disturbance in the open Pacific Ocean on September 2. JMA also started issuing advisories, and it was recognized as a tropical depression in the same location. Two days later, as JTWC also upgraded it into a tropical depression, it received its designation, 13W. The day after, JMA reported that 13W developed into a tropical storm, giving it the name Leepi as the twelfth named storm of this season. Leepi then accelerated northeastwards before it became an extratropical cyclone on September 6.

On September 9, a tropical depression formed over the Micronesian Islands. The following day, the JTWC designated it as 14W. As it moved over Guam, 14W intensified into a tropical storm and was named Bebinca by the JMA. Despite encountering dry air, Bebinca still strengthened as it began its northwestward movement. At 18:00 PHT on September 13, Bebinca entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility and was named Ferdie by PAGASA. Bebinca later strengthened into a minimal typhoon on the next day. On September 16, Bebinca made landfall in Lingang New City in Shanghai as a weakening Category 1 typhoon. Bebinca became the strongest typhoon to hit Shanghai since Typhoon Gloria in 1949.

As Bebinca moved toward eastern China, two tropical depressions formed in the Pacific on September 15—one near Guam and another within the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR). The JTWC designated the depression near Guam as 15W. It soon intensified into a tropical storm and was named Pulasan by the JMA. The other tropical depression, being in the PAR, was given the name Gener by the PAGASA. At 02:00 PHT on September 16, Gener made landfall over Palanan, Isabela. The storm continued to move westward over Northern Luzon, maintaining its strength as a tropical depression. Meanwhile, Pulasan briefly entered the PAR at 18:30 PHT (10:30 UTC) and was given the name Helen. On September 18, two disturbances in the South China Sea, Invests 98W and 99W were expected to merge and strengthen as 98W, closer to Vietnam. Shortly after, Gener was upgraded into a tropical depression by the JTWC, getting the designation 16W. On September 19, 16W was upgraded to a tropical storm and named Soulik by the JMA. Soulik made landfall over Vĩnh Linh District, Quảng Trị Province in Vietnam. Meanwhile, Pulasan also made landfall over Zhoushan, China, similar to where Bebinca had made landfall three days earlier. After that, it made a second landfall over Shanghai, marking the first time since reliable meteorological records exist that two typhoons make landfall over Shanghai with only two days in between.

On September 20, a low-pressure area formed over Northern Luzon. The JTWC later designated the disturbance as Invest 90W upon its formation. As it was inside the PAR, PAGASA initiated advisories and named the system Igme. The JTWC soon upgraded it into a tropical depression, designating it as 17W. Igme later curved southwestwards, passing closely to Taiwan. The storm later dissipated on September 22 after topographical interaction, and high vertical wind shear had significantly weakened the system.

Two days later, on September 24, a tropical depression formed in the Pacific south of Japan. That day, JTWC designated the system as 18W. The following day, the JMA upgraded the depression into a tropical storm, assigning it the name Cimaron. The storm moved southwestwards, maintaining its intensity. As it moved westwards, Cimaron weakened into a tropical depression as an unfavorable environment hindered any intensification. Cimaron later dissipated on September 27. Shortly later the same day, another low-pressure area formed near the Northern Mariana Islands. Despite being in a marginal environment, the disturbance managed to organize and was designated as 19W by the JTWC. On September 27, the JMA upgraded 19W into a tropical storm, naming it Jebi. At first, Jebi struggled to organize due to the presence of moderate low-level wind shear, causing Jebi to weaken into a tropical depression. However, Jebi redeveloped back into a tropical storm after. The storm continued to organize until it further intensified into a Category 1 typhoon by the JTWC, while according to the JMA, it only reached the intensity of a severe tropical storm. Jebi later transitioned to an extratropical cyclone, and both agencies issued their final warning on October 2.

Shortly after Cimaron weakened into a tropical depression, a low-pressure area formed in the Philippine Sea near extreme northern Luzon on September 26. The PAGASA started issuing bulletins regarding the disturbance and was named Julian as it strengthened into a tropical depression. The following day, the JTWC designated Julian as 20W, also upgrading it into a tropical depression. On September 28, the JMA upgraded 20W into a tropical storm, naming it Krathon, a replacement name for Mangkhut. It then intensified into a Category 1 typhoon, heading towards Sabtang, Batanes. Shortly after, the typhoon began its rapid intensification and in two days, the system reached its peak intensity equivalent to a Category 4 super typhoon. On October 3, Krathon made landfall over Siaogang District in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The typhoon became the first storm to make landfall in Taiwan's densely populated western plains since Typhoon Thelma in 1977. The storm weakened while moving inland, marking the first time this had happened in Taiwan since Tropical Storm Trami in 2001. The JMA continued to track the system to the South China Sea before it dissipated on October 4.
Late season activity

On October 5, a tropical depression formed near Guam. The following day, the JTWC designated it as 21W. Despite moving through warm waters, high wind shear hindered any further development, causing it to weaken back into a disturbance. On October 8, the JTWC issued its final warning, with dissipation expected in the next 12 hours. The next day, 21W intensified into a tropical storm, receiving the name Barijat from the JMA. Later in the day, JTWC reissued advisories on Barijat and strengthened into a tropical storm. However, both agencies later made their final warning for the last time as the storm dissipated on October 11.
Flooded rice fields in Camarines Sur after the onslaught of Trami.

On October 19, a tropical depression formed nearby Yap. The next day, it was assigned as 22W by the JTWC. Then, it moved into the PAR and was named Kristine by the PAGASA. Soon after, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and was given the name Trami. Many parts of the Philippines were issued wind storm signals prior to its approach to the country. On October 23, Trami strengthened into a severe tropical storm, prompting the upgrade to Tropical Cyclone Wind Signal No. 3 in parts of northern and central Luzon. At 04:30 UTC on October 24, Trami made landfall over the province of Divilacan, Isabela. The following day, Trami emerged above the coastal waters of southern Ilocos Sur, leaving the remnants of a circulation center over northern Luzon. This caused torrential rains and gusty winds throughout the day in many areas of the country.

Trami continued crossing the South China Sea while maintaining severe tropical storm strength. As it approached the coast of Vietnam, the storm encountered strong easterly vertical wind shear. It made landfall in Da Nang at 10:00 ICT on October 27. Trami then drifted southwestward due to weak steering flow and later made a U-turn over Vietnam's coastal regions. The storm eventually weakened into a low-pressure area, with agencies issuing their final warning on October 29.
Kong-rey making landfall in Chenggong, Taitung in eastern Taiwan on October 31

As Trami crossed the Cordillera Central, another tropical disturbance developed southeast of Guam on October 24. The JMA began monitoring the system as a tropical depression and issued a gale warning. On the following day, the JMA upgraded the disturbance to a tropical storm, naming it Kong-rey. At the same time, another disturbance designated as Invest 99W formed to the north. As a result, the JTWC cancelled warnings for the southern system (Invest 98W) and reclassified Kong-rey under 99W. The JTWC later designated the system as Tropical Depression 23W. The storm then entered the PAR, where it received the local name Leon. On October 29, Kong-rey started undergoing rapid intensification and became a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon the following day. With that, Kong-rey achieved a peak intensify of 1-minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 925 hPa (27.32 inHg).

Shortly after reaching its peak intensity, Kong-rey started to slightly weaken while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle as it tracked northwestward. The typhoon later made a historic landfall over Chenggong, Taitung in Taiwan, marking the first major typhoon to strike the island after mid-October and the most powerful since Typhoon Herb in 1996. Kong-rey then emerged through the Taiwan Strait with a weakened convective structure around the center. It continued to weaken and transitioned to an extratropical cyclone over Sasebo, Japan, prompting both agencies to issue their final advisories on November 1.
Four systems active on November 11: Tropical Storm Yinxing [Marce] (far left); Severe Tropical Storm Toraji [Nika] (upper left); Tropical Storm Usagi [Ofel] (center right); and Tropical Storm Man-yi [Pepito] (far right)

Shortly after Kong-rey transitioned to a post-tropical cyclone, an area of low pressure formed near Palau on November 1. Initially, the JTWC ceased issuing advisories due to unfavorable environmental conditions. However, as the system began to show increased organization two days later, the JTWC resumed advisories. At 14:00 UTC on November 3, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression, with the former assigning it the designation 24W. Later that day, at 18:00 UTC, it intensified into a tropical storm and was named Yinxing by the JMA, the replacement name for Yutu. Upon entering the PAR, Yinxing received the local name Marce from the PAGASA. It continued to intensify over the Philippine Sea, prompting both agencies to classify it as a typhoon the following day. It then reached its peak intensity of a Category 4-equivalent typhoon, with 1-minute sustained winds of 230 km/h (145 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 940 hPa (27.76 inHg). At around 15:40 PHT (07:40 UTC) on November 7, Yinxing made landfall over Santa Ana, Cagayan. After traversing the Babuyan Channel in the Luzon Strait, it made its second landfall over Sanchez Mira, Cagayan. The storm slightly weakened into a Category 2-equivalent typhoon after making landfall, but later reintensified as a Category 3-equivalent typhoon on November 9 as it moved into the South China Sea. On November 10, Yinxing was steadily weakening, with its CDO becoming more asymmetric as it encountered cooler sea surface temperatures and increasing vertical wind shear. The storm moved southwestward between two mid-level subtropical ridges, and its convective structure became increasingly asymmetric. Strong southwesterly shear disrupted the central dense overcast and exposed the low-level circulation, prompting the JMA to downgrade the system to a tropical storm at 00:00 UTC. Despite maintaining a compact circulation with an eye-like feature near the southern coast of Vietnam, convection remained disorganized. At 07:00 UTC on November 12, Yinxing made landfall just north of Quy Nhơn. The JTWC issued its final warning shortly after landfall, with the JMA continuing to monitor the system until it dissipated inland at 18:00 UTC the same day.

On November 8, a tropical disturbance developed east of Southern Luzon and began moving westward in a favorable environment. At 08:00 PHT (00:00 UTC) on the following day, the system entered the PAR and was assigned the name Nika by the PAGASA. Shortly afterward, another area of low pressure formed near the Marshall Islands and was designated as Invest 93W. With favorable conditions and low vertical wind shear, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system. Later that day, both 93W and Nika were upgraded to tropical depressions, with the systems designated as 25W and 26W respectively.
Typhoon Man-yi making landfall in Panganiban, Catanduanes on November 16

Later that day, both systems intensified into tropical storms and were named Man-yi and Toraji by the JMA. On November 10, Toraji continued to strengthen and was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA, while the JTWC classified it as a Category 1 typhoon as its outer bands became more organized. The JMA subsequently upgraded Toraji to typhoon status before it made landfall in Dilasag, Aurora. The system then exited into the South China Sea near Magsingal, Ilocos Sur, with satellite imagery showing a compact and tightly wrapped low-level circulation. As Toraji moved northwestward, its low-level circular convection weakened over the center, and the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm on November 11. Satellite imagery later showed a weakening of deep convection at its center, with low-level cloud banding visible around the center and along the southern edge of the circulation. This was attributed to strong southerly vertical wind shear as the system became embedded in the low-level northeasterly flow associated with a cold surge. As a result of convective decapitation that left the low-level circulation fully exposed, the JTWC issued its final advisory on November 14, downgrading the system to a tropical depression. The JMA continued monitoring the system until it was last noted at 06:00 UTC on November 15.

Meanwhile, on November 9, a tropical depression formed near Micronesia. The following day, the JMA began issuing warnings on the system. On November 11, the JTWC upgraded it into a tropical depression, designating it as 27W. By early morning of the next day, 27W intensified into a tropical storm, prompting the JMA to assign the name Usagi. This marks the first time in reliable meteorological records that four active systems were active simultaneously in the basin during November.[9] Around the same time, Usagi entered the PAR, receiving the local name Ofel from PAGASA. The storm continued to intensify and underwent a period of rapid intensification, reaching Category 4-equivalent super typhoon strength on November 14. At 13:30 PHT (05:30 UTC) of the same day, Usagi made landfall over Baggao, Cagayan. After landfall, Usagi began to weaken as its eye became obscured due to interaction with mountainous terrain. After crossing northern Luzon, it emerged into the Babuyan Channel, moving northwestward along the edge of a mid-level subtropical high. The system passed near the Babuyan Islands and northern Cagayan, prompting the JMA to downgrade it to a severe tropical storm. Satellite imagery showed a weakening low-level circulation with convection displaced northeast of a partially exposed center. As Usagi drifted southwest of Taiwan, it continued to weaken due to strong vertical wind shear, leading the JTWC to issue its final warning on November 16. The JMA monitored the system until it dissipated at 12:00 UTC on the same day.

Upon being named Usagi as 27W, the Western Pacific basin experienced a rare meteorological occurrence on November 12: two typhoons were active in the South China Sea simultaneously for the first time since Angela in 1992. It also marked the first time since records began in 1951 that four tropical cyclones were simultaneously active in November, and the first time in the basin since 1970.

Meanwhile, after maintaining tropical storm strength for five days, the JMA upgraded Man-yi to a severe tropical storm as it entered a more favorable environment. At 20:00 PHT (12:00 UTC) on November 14, the storm entered the PAR, where it was given the name Pepito by the PAGASA. By early on November 16, Man-yi had rapidly intensified and peaked as a super typhoon, with estimated 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) and a central pressure of 920 hPa (27.1 inHg). At 21:40 PHT (13:40 UTC), Man-yi made its first landfall over Panganiban, Catanduanes, bringing destructive winds and torrential rain. The following day, it made a second landfall in Dipaculao, Aurora in Luzon at around 15:20 PHT (07:20 UTC).[10], with the Sierra Madre mountain range disrupting its structure and causing the eye to collapse. Man-yi then accelerated northwestward into the South China Sea, weakening into a severe tropical storm as vertical wind shear increased. The JTWC issued its final warning on November 19 as Man-yi weakened into a tropical depression, while the JMA continued monitoring the system until it was last noted at 06:00 UTC on November 20.

After several weeks of inactivity, a low-pressure area developed southeast of Mindanao on December 17. The following day, the disturbance entered the PAR, where it was classified as a tropical depression and assigned the name Querubin by PAGASA, replacing the retired name Quinta. Despite favorable environmental conditions, Querubin struggled to organize due to its proximity to land, which hindered development. The JTWC issued two TCFAs, citing a high probability of intensification. However, as Querubin crossed between the Visayas and Mindanao, PAGASA issued its final advisory on December 18, declaring it a well-marked low-pressure area. The JTWC continued to monitor the system, though downgraded it to a low chance of development, before ceasing bulletins the following day.

The final tropical cyclone of 2024 developed on December 20 over northeast Malaysia and was designated as Invest 98W. The system brought gusty winds across Sarawak, Sabah, and Brunei throughout its formation. The next day, the JTWC issued a TCFA, citing high chances of development. However, the emergence of a nearby disturbance, designated Invest 99W, led the JTWC to lower the development potential of 98W and shift focus to the new system. Despite remaining outside the PAR, the PAGASA named the disturbance Romina, replacing the retired name Rolly due to its potential impact on the Kalayaan Islands. This marked the first time PASAGA has assigned a local name to a system outside the PAR since 1963. The JTWC later designated Romina as 28W, and the JMA subsequently upgraded it to a tropical storm, assigning the international name Pabuk. The storm tracked westward before turning toward Vietnam, weakening into a tropical depression as it encountered strong low-level northeasterly flow associated with a cold surge. The final advisory on Pabuk was issued at 18:00 UTC on December 25 as it degenerated into a well-marked low-pressure area.
